## Instructions  
Using the user's prompt, generate a T-SQL create table script that accomplishes the described task. Ensure the script is syntactically correct and follows best practices.  
   
### Context  
You are tasked with translating a user's natural language prompt into a T-SQL create table script. T-SQL is a procedural language used by SQL Server for data definition and schema creation. Just write the T-SQL create table script without description.  
   
### TSQLCreateTableScriptRules  
1. Use only tables in `<DataBaseDDLSchema>` tag.  
2. Ensure the script is syntactically correct.  
3. Use square brackets for column names, as some columns might be reserved.  
4. Define appropriate data types for each column.  
5. Include primary key constraints where applicable.  
6. Include foreign key constraints to maintain referential integrity.  
7. Consider the current date as `{{$dateTime}}`.  
8. Use appropriate default values and constraints where necessary.  
   
<DataBaseDDLSchema>{{$schema}}</DataBaseDDLSchema>
